Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler


<!-- About -->
For this assignment I created a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

Use the daily planner to create a schedule. The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. When you scroll down you're presented with timeblocks for standard business hours. When you view the timeblocks for that day, each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. Simply click on a timeblock and enter a task. When you click the save button for that timeblock, the text for that task is saved in local storage.
